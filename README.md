# mntkonferansen-latex
LaTeX class and styles for contributions to the Norwegian MNT-konferansen.

The class is actively developed leading up to the final submission
date for the conference at the end of January 2019.  If you have
trouble, please contact the developer(s) (below).

## The files:

- template.tex a simple demo to show usage and appearance.
  With the following auxiliary files:
  - Makefile
  - Lenna.jpg
  - template.bib
  
- mnt.cls is the class file

- apalike.bst is a simple modification of the standard apalike
  bibliography style using a macro instead of hardcoding the word
  «and».  The class file defines the macro, supporting translations
  for babel options norsk and nynorsk.
